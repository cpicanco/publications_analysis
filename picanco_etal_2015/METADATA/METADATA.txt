# - 1-20 lines gives you the first session, 21-40 the second, and so on.
# - 1-5 (6-10, and so on) gives you all the sample-comparison pairs (e.g., A1-B1 and A1-B2)
#  from a single discriminative relation presented during the corresponding session.

index
From 1 upto the maximum number of trials presented during each stage (A^1, B^1, A^2 or B^2). Further,
'index' is a unique indentifier assigned after ordering the session data (1-20, 21-40...) from A to Z by its "nname" or "pname". Each 'index' is associated with a positive AND a negative trial.

Sessions were indexed (unique indentifier) after being ordered from A to Z by its "nname" or "pname".
If you need the original occurence order of a trial inside a session, see "oiposi" or "oinega". 

oiposi
Original Index for Positive Relations
Indicates the original order that the a positive trial was presented in a session.

oinega
Original Index for Negative Relations
Indicates the original order that the a positive trial was presented in a session.

pname
Positive Name
Name (tag) of the a positive trial.
1-5 (6-10, and so on) trials gives you a pair of sample-comparison relations (e.g., A1-B1 and A1-B2).
Hence, discriminative indexes for each relation can be calculated.

nname
Negative Name
Name (tag) of the a negative trial.
1-5 (6-10, and so on) trials gives you a pair of sample-comparison relations (e.g., A1-B1 and A1-B2).
Hence, discriminative indexes for each relation can be calculated.

pright
For positive trials "go" was a Correct response (TRUE) and "no-go" was an Incorrect response (FALSE).

nright
For negative trials "no-go" was a Correct response (TRUE) and "go" was an Incorrect response (FALSE).
